# HuffmanCoding
Data compression using Huffman Coding, currently completed an encoder in JavaScript. Capable of compressing small strings, not optimized for paragraphs or files yet.<br/>
I would like to continue to grow this repository to support many languages and to be able to compress large text files and more.
