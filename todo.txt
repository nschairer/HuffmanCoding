// In the following order
1. Set an EOF special character before encoding the string such as Ã˜
2. After encoding and compressing, try setting a conditional within the huffmanDecoder to see if we can get the correct binary string (console log before compression and after decompression)
3. Figure out whether the tree encoder works and how to decode/rebuild it. Also, try writing to the same file instead of a different file.
